Philosophy behind this screen

    Us, were individuals in this vast universe. Our actions contribute to this chaotic but ordered world. Our thought has its own consequence, as well as our actions. Our actions contribute as a whole might not come out as you expected. To see this world as a whole, compares individual thought's enery and consequence with many other similar ones. Though you can measure your own, but you may not be able to measure others'. The unknowns won't be answered all the time.

    Everyone somehow has to face this chaos to make its own actions. We are able to change our own actions as well as things that happens to us. We make changes to things we wish to experience or avoid. All the unexpected things are not necessarily bad but surely less known and investigated.
